COGS 121 Assignment 2 README

SIX DESIGN PRINCIPLES:

1. Discoverability/Signifiers - Are users able to easily find the points of the application that they are interested in?
	-hgh contrast of colors to draw attention to salient points aka points of high activity on map.
	-legend/key for users to reference, all in one consensed, familiar area. 

2. Learnability - Are users able to easily learn and remember how to interact with your application?
	-minimal features, so there isnt a lot of room for debate as to what does what????
	-

3. Feedback - Is there strong evidence of user feedback for actionable items?
	-Map updates bubbles if user preferences which level of activity they want shown.

4. Natural Mapping/Mental Metaphors - Is there strong evidence of providing natural mappings or relatable metaphors that help the user navigate the application?
	-using an actual map so like duh


5. Constraints - Does the application have deliberate constraints to guide the flow of user interaction?
	-WILL NOT be able to update realtime thoguh becuase that data isnt available to us on delphi



6. Error Prevention/Recovery - Is there strong evidence of error prevention and error recovery so that the user wonâ€™t be left confused when something unexpected happens?
	-zoomout capability after having zoomed in
	-with overlapping bubbles, high probability if  misclicking to zoom in? maybe a single click to highlight the bubble, and then a doubleclick to zoom? GOTTA MAKE IT KNOWN THO 


DECISION JUSTIFICATION:

	We did this shit because...

	ex. If you used any external CSS/JS libraries (ie. Boostrap, Materialize) analyze what motivated your team to do so and describe how it fits into your design goals. 

	ex. If you implemented any custom CSS/JS components explain why this decision was appropriate and how did it fit into your design.
